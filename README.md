SQL challenge week 9 
This weeks challenge included creating realtional database with 6 tables.
Here one needs to keep in mind the order of populating these tables.
first the FK dependent tables have to be loaded. e.g I loaded the title table then the employee and then the Salary for the table to be loaded without failing on the Key constraints.
